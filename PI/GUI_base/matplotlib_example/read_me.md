three files used here to generate a matplotlib figure in pyqt 
    -the ui file generated with qtdesigner
    -the mplwidget defines a custom user defined widget ... we must use this name when creating the widget in the qtdesigner...(see the tutorial in html file ) 
    -the miain.py file loads the ui file into python and starts adding slots and signals to it.
